# My projects
I specialise in Javascript (ES6+) and Typescript, NodeJS and Angular (v4+), and also have plenty of experience with PHP and Laravel. Here are a few of my best personal projects:

## Discord-style Real-time Chat App
An app I made that is heavily inspired by the popular chat app Discord.

Built with NodeJS, MongoDB and Angular 5 and using Websockets for low latency and high throughput. Built in a test-driven style, I aim for over 99% test coverage throughout the app. View the
[source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Hughp135/angular-5-chat-app). 

As well as working in-browser app, the app is also downloadable as a cross-platform desktop app (using Electron).

Live demo coming soon.

## Game community website [osustuff.org](https://www.osustuff.org)
Built in my spare time while studying for my Computer Science degree, this website was originally made for a game called osu! It includes tools such as an [Avatar Maker](https://www.osustuff.org/avatar-maker) which allows users to easily create personalised profile pictures.

The back-end of the site is built in Laravel, and uses AngularJS for the front-end. The website gets over 15k average monthly visitors.
