# About me
Full-stack Web Developer who specialises in Javascript and PHP. My front-end frameworks of choice are Angular and React. Here are a couple of my personal projects:

## [Real-Time Chat App](https://github.com/Hughp135/angular-5-chat-app)
A real-time communications/chat app built with NodeJS, MongoDB and Angular 5 and using Websockets. Heavily inspired by Discord and Slack.

## [osustuff.org](https://www.osustuff.org)
Built in my spare time while studying for my degree. A gaming website made for the community with useful tools on it such as the [Avatar Maker](https://www.osustuff.org/avatar-maker). Built with Laravel and Angular (v1) plus a lot of HTML/SCSS/JS/jQuery.
