## [Product Customisation Shopify App](https://foxbox.io)

A Shopify-base app with an Angular v6 front-end that allows shops to have customisable products. To see the customisation app in action, go onto a product page and click Customize [Direct Example](https://foxbox.io/apps/product-editor/32270605194). The back-end is build in NodeJS and uses the Shopify API to integrate a back-end admin panel and print out the custom designs that customers have made.

Built with Laravel and Angular (v6) plus a lot of HTML/SCSS/JS/jQuery.
