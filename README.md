## `osustuff.org`

Built in my spare time while studying for my degree. A gaming website made for the community with useful image editing tools such as the [Avatar Maker](https://www.osustuff.org/avatar-maker2) and [Banner Maker](https://www.osustuff.org/banner-maker). Built with Laravel and Angular (v6) plus a lot of HTML/SCSS/JS/jQuery.

## `Real-time Game Streaming App`

A web and desktop app that allows users to live-stream video and take control of their home computer from any device over the internet or local network. A desktop app (built in Electron) captures the display of the computer and uses WebRTC and WebSocket technology to stream video and input data bi-directionally with as little as 20ms of latency to deliver a smooth gaming experience.
